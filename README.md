# 🛡️ System Threat Forecaster

The goal of this project is to predict a system’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and system infections was generated by threat reports collected by antivirus software.

This project uses machine learning techniques to forecast potential system threats based on historical security data. It was developed as part of a college project and is based on a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/System-Threat-Forecaster).
