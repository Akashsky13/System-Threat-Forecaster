# System-Threat-Forecaster
The goal of this project is to predict a systemâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by system's antivirus software.
This project uses machine learning techniques to forecast potential system threats based on historical security data. It was developed as part of a college project and based on a [Kaggle competition]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/System-Threat-Forecaster/)) (link here if applicable).

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model Evaluation and Tuning
## ðŸ“¥ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from the [System Threat Forecaster]([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/system-threat-forecaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/System-Threat-Forecaster)) competition on Kaggle.

Due to Kaggleâ€™s terms of service, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.

Please follow these steps to set up the data:

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/system-threat-forecaster/data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/System-Threat-Forecaster/data)).
2. Create a folder called `data/` in the root of this project.
3. Place the following files inside the `data/` folder:
   - `train.csv`
   - `test.csv`
   - `sample_submission.csv`
4. Then, run the notebook or script.
